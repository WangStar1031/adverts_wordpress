Would you buy twice from a website that does not give you instantly access to the product you purchased? And as a seller, why would you want to complicate the life of your customer?

== Description ==
By design, WooCommerce instantly completes only orders containing "Downloadable" products, upon payment. Orders of virtual products must wait for a manual approval from the shop manager. Installing this plugin you will have the opportunity to let WooCommerce process orders automatically if the payment is complete:
   
* Paid orders of virtual products only: orders containing "Virtual" products only will be completed upon successful payment.  
* All paid orders of any product: orders of any product (even physical) will be turned to "Completed" upon successful payment.  
* All orders (!): each and every order will turn to "Completed" irrespective of the payment status.   
      
Please be aware that the third mode allows the customer to access the product immediately before the payment is completed.    

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin\'s folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or install it through the integrated plugin installer    
1. Activate the plugin through the \'Plugins\' menu in WordPress     
1. Navigate to WooCommerce > Settings > Extra Options in your Dashboard

Please deactivate my plugin (or select mode "Off"), test with a product marked as "virtual" and "downloadable". If it still doesn\'t work, then there\'s something wrong in your WooCommerce configuration or in your payment gateway. If it does work, please log an issue on the [support page](http://www.seriousplugins.com/woocommerce-autocomplete-orders/support/)!
