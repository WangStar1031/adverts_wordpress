WC Auto Complete Orders is a simple, no UI plugin that does what it says: Enables Woo Commerce orders to automatically be marked as complete upon checkout.

== Description ==
Tired of having to mark orders as complete or making your virtual orders as downloadable even when you don't have anything for your clients to download just so your orders will be marked as complete automatically? I was too that is why I made this simple plugin :).

Simply install, activate and every new order will be marked as complete automatically instead of processing or pending.

== Installation ==
Best is to install directly from WordPress. If manual installation is required, please make sure that the plugin files are in a folder named “wc-auto-complete-orders” in the WordPress plugins folder, usually “wp-content/plugins”.
